# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel Project)

This project analyzes customer data from a bike retailer to understand purchasing patterns and customer behavior. The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel using data cleaning, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The original dataset `bike_buyers` contains demographic and lifestyle information for 1,000 customers, including:
- Gender, Marital Status, and Age
- Income, Education Level, and Occupation
- Region, Commute Distance, and Car Ownership
- Whether the customer purchased a bike

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Transformation

All cleaning and transformation were done in a copy of the original dataset (`Working sheet`) to preserve raw data.

### Key Cleaning Steps:

1. **Standardized Categorical Values**  
   - Replaced abbreviations with readable values (e.g., `M` → `Male`, `S` → `Single`).

2. **Created New Columns**  
   - Added an **Age Bracket** column by applying the following formula to the entire **Age** column:  
     ```
     =IF([Age]>54, "Old", IF([Age]>=31, "Middle Age", IF([Age]<31, "Adolescent", "Invalid")))
     ```
     This categorized each customer into:
     - *Adolescent* (under 31)  
     - *Middle Age* (31–54)  
     - *Old* (55 and above)  
     This transformation enabled age-based segmentation in the dashboard.

3. **Verified and Corrected Missing or Inconsistent Entries**  
   - Ensured consistency in fields like Education and Occupation.


## 📊 Tools & Features Used

- **Pivot Tables:**  
  Used to explore and analyze:
  - Bike purchase trends by age, gender, income, education
  - Regional and occupational patterns
  - Impact of commute distance and car ownership

- **Dashboards:**  
  Interactive and visual representation of:
  - Total buyers by category
  - Purchase breakdowns by key demographics
  - Comparative insights using slicers and charts

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Age and Income** are strong indicators of bike purchase.
- **Married individuals** and **those with longer commutes** are more likely to purchase bikes.
- **Education and occupation** influence purchasing behavior significantly.

## 📌 File Structure

- `bike_buyers`: Original dataset (unchanged)
- `Working sheet`: Cleaned data with transformations
- `PivotTables`: Analytical summaries
- `Dashboard`: Interactive visual insights

## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a streamlined Excel-based data analysis workflow — from cleaning to insights — demonstrating strong Excel skills for business and data roles.
