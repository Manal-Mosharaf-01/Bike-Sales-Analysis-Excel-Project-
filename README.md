# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel Project)

This project analyzes customer data from a bike retailer to understand purchasing patterns and customer behavior. The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel using data cleaning, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The original dataset `bike_buyers` contains demographic and lifestyle information for 1,000 customers, including:
- Gender, Marital Status, and Age
- Income, Education Level, and Occupation
- Region, Commute Distance, and Car Ownership
- Whether the customer purchased a bike

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Transformation

All cleaning and transformation were done in a copy of the original dataset (`Working sheet`) to preserve raw data.

### Key Cleaning Steps:
1. **Standardized Categorical Values**  
   - Replaced abbreviations with readable values (e.g., `M` → `Male`, `S` → `Single`).

2. **Created New Columns**  
   - Added a new column to group customers into **Age Brackets** (e.g., *Middle Age*, *Old*) for easier segmentation.

3. **Verified and Corrected Missing or Inconsistent Entries**  
   - Ensured consistency in fields like Education and Occupation.

## 📊 Tools & Features Used

- **Pivot Tables:**  
  Used to explore and analyze:
  - Bike purchase trends by age, gender, income, education
  - Regional and occupational patterns
  - Impact of commute distance and car ownership

- **Dashboards:**  
  Interactive and visual representation of:
  - Total buyers by category
  - Purchase breakdowns by key demographics
  - Comparative insights using slicers and charts

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Age and Income** are strong indicators of bike purchase.
- **Married individuals** and **those with longer commutes** are more likely to purchase bikes.
- **Education and occupation** influence purchasing behavior significantly.

## 📌 File Structure

- `bike_buyers`: Original dataset (unchanged)
- `Working sheet`: Cleaned data with transformations
- `PivotTables`: Analytical summaries
- `Dashboard`: Interactive visual insights

## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a streamlined Excel-based data analysis workflow — from cleaning to insights — demonstrating strong Excel skills for business and data roles.
